Download https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip. Don't download it if it's already downloaded
Iterate over all zip files but read only md and mdx ones
Remove the first part of the path in the filename. So "fastmcp-main/docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx" becomes "docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx"
Index these files with minsearch. Put the text content in "content" field and filename in "filename"
Use https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch to learn how to use minsearch
Create a search function that retrieves 5 most relevant documents from the index
Create search.py and test the implementation there
