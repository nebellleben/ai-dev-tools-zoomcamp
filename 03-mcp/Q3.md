Create a tool (in python) for downloading content of any web page. Use Jina reader. To do so, simply add r.jina.ai in front of the address. For example to download http://datatalks.club, simply visit https://r.jina.ai/https://datatalks.club. Use the "requests" library.

Also create a file `test.py` which invokes this function to test that it works well.
